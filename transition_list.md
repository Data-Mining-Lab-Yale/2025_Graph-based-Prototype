## May
Initial Data Analasis: distribution and structure alignment with common NLP units
- Data initial observation: script-> input/output/main goals, document-> structure alignment with distribution
- Literature review for graph-related NLP abstraction
- Implementation Environment set up -> environment.yaml export
- Postdoc symposium presentation proposing briding the hierachical narrative with healthcare (poster file)
- Proposal writing: Conceputuallize, ideation, and lead whole document writing for two versions (Yale AI seed grant). 1. Communication 2. Education 


## June
NLP Graph Abstgractions on Clause-level classification
- Literature review for graph-related NLP abstraction
- Data format preprocessing: script-> input/output/main goals
- Implementation and documentation: script-> input/output/main goals, document-> structure alignment with distribution

## July
Workshop paper draft (need to be split from mixed followed analysis) - July 20th.
- Initial Results (5 type graph experiments, with 1 type of narrative concept combine method)
- Conclusion for this part: performance issue founded, looking for potential bottleneck
- literature reivew for ML potential bottlenecks
- Identify possible investigate directions (imbalance, semantic ambiguity, span inconsistancy, graph method feasibility in current settings) 

## August
Further investigation about method feasibililty and data quality
- Two reports: 1. graph abstraction feasibility in current task settings (clause-level classifications) 2. Data analysis for four potential influence factors (imbalance, semantic ambiguity, span inconsistancy, graph method feasibility in current settings)
- Implementation and documentation: script-> input/output/main goals for all the analysis

## September
 
- Semnatic conflict analysis with tf-idf, LSA, sbert, jaccard - identify the current annotation align more with lexicon level
- The processing pipeline design and figure
- WOVEN data analysis and basic processing: 1. clean the format and removing incomplete records 2. count the distributions 3. manually annotate certain charactersitic label for the data with developed basic imterface. 4. local LLLM scripts for automatical labeling.
Given the data quality is low, lexicon level annotation policy, and annotation noise, investigate methods to construct rules from outside (non-annotators)
- literature review for reverse-engineering for noise label and how ML learns under noise labels

## Octobor

- literature review for how NLP processing "intent" and proposed there should be two conceptual categories (interaction action and goal-oriented)
- Consider the two intent types (based on)to construct two sample sets to get cleaner set, reduce the imbalance issue and the intangle of semantic conflicts. 
- data processing scripts for retrieve the sameple sets and for Bathesta data (a smaller set based on new annotation rules) and its semantic conflict analysis
- design and expeirment on pobability distrution forming from conflict label pool and use as decision guidances.
- documented the dataset (sample sets anaylsis) and results from the decision rule construction experiments
Explore the visual narrative research apply to medical domain 
- survey papers and formed a set of reference pool
- Two presentations for selected paper
Resign and prepare transtiion
- Team discussions for brain storming
- Notes for investigating challenge in patient-provider communications
- (On going) literature review for virtual patient and how they combine with healthcare
- (On going)

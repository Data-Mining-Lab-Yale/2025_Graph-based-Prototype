I can not get off work before you close at any time this week. my fear is that it is or might turn into a staff infection. I have not had a staff infection for a while now. Is there any way that you could all in Bactrim DS to clear up any infection that is there. In the past Bactrim is the only antibotice that has worked. If you could call and leave me a message on my phone. I will not be able to answer your call while I am at work. Thank you for your time. XXX-XXX-XXXX\n",

However, I only have enough medicine for MM/DD/YYYY, and I was wondering if I could just get some filled to last me until my appointment.   I also wanted to ask if you know how long lab results would take. I was planning to take my labs at the start of the week so they'd be ready for MM/DD/YYYY, but the roads are icing so I'm trying not to travel far. Would it be best to reschedule with the Endocrinologist to make sure I have time for that, and to just go for a normal checkup on MM/DD/YYYY. Or would the results be quick enough that I won't have to worry about it as long as I do it before MM/DD/YYYY? Sorry for the long question.  Thank you.     My number is XXX-XXX-XXXX\n",

I woke up in the middle of the night with bad stomach and back pains with nausea.  I never did vomit, but hurt continually.  The pain and nausea finally subsided a bit around 7am MM/DD/YYYY morning, but have continued over the last several days.  I have tried to drink hot tea, water and only eating scrambled eggs and soup as I can tolerate.  I get heartburn really bad and pain after I eat.  My bowel movements have been few and I have severe bloated feelings all the time.  I do have bowel sounds, but am not passing a lot.  Color varies, but have not noticed any Black & Tarry stools.  The pain I am experiencing is mid stomach area and spreads around to my lower and mid back region, as well as bad pain in the esophageal sphincter area, especially after I eat anything.  I can hardly sleep due to the discomfort and cannot hardly eat anything.   Please try to get me in asap so we can find out what is going on.  I cannot keep dealing with this.

They have been very understanding with my situation but I would like to give them documentation that I am doing my best in finding a resolution to my symptoms. I have given it alot of thought and do not feel comfortable driving with my symptoms especially starting new medications and waiting for MRI results as  well as waiting for my rheumatologist appointment.  I appreciate your help and I'm so grateful for the Org4 team as I'm going through this difficult time. Have a wonderful day.   Person3\n",

I need to be seen by ya'll, but would like a recommendation to go to another dr for the car injury that ya'll would trust to take care of me and my pain. I am also low on my Rybelus.

Anyway, thanks for your reassurance in the meantime. That helps a lot. Do I ditch the Xanax completely once I get the new med or still take one before bed?   Thanks,  Gillian   Gillian, I got your message and I have sent in hydroxyzine for you to try on as needed basis.  Unlike alprazolam (xanax), hydroxyzine is not habit forming and safer for long term use.  Also, please continue to check with our front office if you aren't able to get in to counseller anywhere else.  We have a new one starting soon, and the schedule should open soon for her appointments.

I'm on my 4th week with no front teeth. When my original appointment on the MM/DD/YYYY was canceled because you hadn't gotten my partials in yet, I was told I could be squeezed in on MM/DD/YYYY, and IF my partials came in early, you would try to see IF you could get me in sooner.    I'm sending this message hoping that IF is a possibility!! I appreciate the work that you guys do, truly, and I know y'all stay busy! But I have to negotiate on MM/DD/YYYY with a contractor at my house, and even worse I have 2 Easter lunch banquets I have to attend this weekend for church ministries I'm very involved in!! I've been struggling and coping and just wearing masks as I lisp terribly with no front teeth, but these are events I can't cancel, and I'm expected to eat in front of a lot of people. I'M BEGGING Y'ALL to PLEASE fit me in asap if my partials finally came in!  Sorry for the hassle, and if you can't I totally understand! I just thought it would be worth a shot to see if it was a possiblility.    Thank you! Person1\n",

It started over the weekend and has steadily increased even with taking advil and using 4% lidocaine cream. The pain gets beyond a 10 daily now because I have to work and forcing the strain is increasing the pain 10 fold. I have an appointment to have my BP checked by a nurse tomorrow morning at 8:40, please let me know what you find out by then. If needed test results in my file show the severity of my back issues, (xrays and nerve tests are in there) the digeneration of my lower spine was even seen on my last MRI/ abdominal scan. I just need to manage the pain so I can continue working please. Thank You Person1\n",

I was almost wondering if there was an affordable alternative to help treat my ADD, because I do not feel that is as effective as it was before.

    "message": "[Reply]Outside referral  Hello  Mrs, Roach   I received a message from our Person2 here in clinic stating your request of a Diagnotic ultrasound, I spoke with the provider that saw you last and placed your last order. unfortunately we can not proceed with this request. Per provider she would like for you to dola screening, not diagnostic. This can be a self pay or we can go through another program that is called ABCF i can not guarantee that it will be approve. Please let me know of what would you like to do. Thank you [Originally sent by: Person3]     Yes I would like to proceed with this my only question is how is the screening different from a mammogram that I just had? The mammogram does not show what an ultrasound does. Iâ€™m just scared that since there is breast cancer in my family that a mammogram does not detect because I have dense breast. My sister was able to have hers detected in stage one and without the diagnostic ultrasound it would have not shown in the early stage. Why canâ€™t I get any help with this. I do no have any other insurance that I can use nor do I have the money for self pay\n",

    "message": "[Reply][Reply][Reply]Outside referral   Hello  Mrs, Roach   I received a message from our Person2 here in clinic stating your request of a Diagnotic ultrasound, I spoke with the provider that saw you last and placed your last order. unfortunately we can not proceed with this request. Per provider she would like for you to dola screening, not diagnostic. This can be a self pay or we can go through another program that is called ABCF i can not guarantee that it will be approve. Please let me know of what would you like to do. Thank you [Originally sent by: Person3]     Yes I would like to proceed with this my only question is how is the screening different from a mammogram that I just had? The mammogram does not show what an ultrasound does. Iâ€™m just scared that since there is breast cancer in my family that a mammogram does not detect because I have dense breast. My sister was able to have hers detected in stage one and without the diagnostic ultrasound it would have not shown in the early stage. Why canâ€™t I get any help with this. I do no have any other insurance that I can use nor do I have the money for self pay  [Message from: ROACH, PILAR] Yes proceed with this request please  I am sorry, I am following provider order in regards of the referral order. Since NETH don't cover the screening it would have to be a self pay or go through the ABCF grant. I can go ahead and send out an order to ABCF  if you would like to give it try fro that grant.

I am writing today because I think I misunderstood about the visit requirements for my LamoTRIgine 100 mg TAB UNI. It is my understanding that we picked this medicine because it was one that did not require 30 day visits unless there was a change in dosage.  If no change then every 90 days.   In any case, my circumstances are keeping me from getting there for a visit to get a refill. Transportation and finances are the barriers at this time.  I really feel that the medicine has helped me tremendously and with the recent passing of my brother, after 3 years of taking care of him, I really do not want to stop taking this medication.   Until all of these items can be clarified and sorted it out, is it possible to get an interim refill? I have two more doses. If so, please be sure this is sent to the Org2 on Org2.    Thank you so much for your time, Person1  ps. I sent to both authorized receivers in the address box because I was not sure what to do.\n",

She said that she sent the visit summary over to you and would like to work with you to get some tests completed. I know I need a punch biopsy, colonoscopy, and blood work. Anything that you could help me get to avoid the high pricing at Person4 would be greatly appreciated. She gave me a phone number that you can reach her at if you would like to come up with a plan or need to discuss anything with her. Please let me know what you need me to do next and as always I appreciate your care and help and I wouldn't be on the right path without you, Person2, and most importantly God!  Thank you. PS. I have been in awful condition before the steroids.. I can barely get out of bed without them Therefore I have been taking them and will need notice if I should stop taking them before testing.\n",

Hello  Mrs, Roach   I received a message from our Person2 here in clinic stating your request of a Diagnotic ultrasound, I spoke with the provider that saw you last and placed your last order. unfortunately we can not proceed with this request. Per provider she would like for you to dola screening, not diagnostic. This can be a self pay or we can go through another program that is called ABCF i can not guarantee that it will be approve. Please let me know of what would you like to do. Thank you [Originally sent by: Person3]     Yes I would like to proceed with this my only question is how is the screening different from a mammogram that I just had? The mammogram does not show what an ultrasound does. Iâ€™m just scared that since there is breast cancer in my family that a mammogram does not detect because I have dense breast. My sister was able to have hers detected in stage one and without the diagnostic ultrasound it would have not shown in the early stage. Why canâ€™t I get any help with this. I do no have any other insurance that I can use nor do I have the money for self pay  [Message from: ROACH, PILAR] Yes proceed with this request please  I am sorry, I am following provider order in regards of the referral order. Since Org7 don't cover the screening it would have to be a self pay or go through the ABCF grant. I can go ahead and send out an order to Org7  if you would like to give it try fro that grant.   [Originally sent by: Person3] [Message from: ROACH, PILAR]    I faxed over referral, Person5 from ABCF will give you all. Thank you [Originally sent by: Person3]\n",

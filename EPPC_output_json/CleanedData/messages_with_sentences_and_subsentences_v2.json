As part of that test, could you also ensure a blood clotting time test is included please. My stomach is a mass of hematoma now as a result of the self injecting and this seems to be happening because my blood is too thin. In speaking with the vascular cardiologist there is also question mark as to whether there really was a partial blood clot in my vein as well. Would love to get back on to the Eliquis if I can.

We request that Dr Person5 ask for a conversation with the Medical Director of Org9 to explain the need for the rehab stay. I have given more detailed context on this point to Person7. The appeal process and phone number to call is in the attached rejection letter. We believe a peer to peer conversation between physicians might support this application. In add ition we are going to research other facilities to see if there is a different place that might be more likely to get approved.

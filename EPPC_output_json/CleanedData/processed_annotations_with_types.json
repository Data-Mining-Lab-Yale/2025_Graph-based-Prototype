I thought we were doing the CA 27 Dash 29 that I have always had done but no results have come in for that. A test result for CEA came in but I don't know what that is. I have nothing to compare that to although it appears the numbers pretty high which is concerning. I was wondering if there was a reason for switching to a different test?

You can send it to me in here or email, address@email.com. No rush, at your convenience. Thank you, Person2.",

We request that Dr Person5 ask for a conversation with the Medical Director of Org9 to explain the need for the rehab stay. I have given more detailed context on this point to Person7. The appeal process and phone number to call is in the attached rejection letter. We believe a peer to peer conversation between physicians might support this application.

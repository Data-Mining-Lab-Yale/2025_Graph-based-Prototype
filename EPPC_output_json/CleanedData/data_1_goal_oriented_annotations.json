Given my history of ulcerative colitis, I am concerned about diarrhea, and I am Very concerned about the Verzenio pill regarding diarrhea. We also could not recall the length of time these therapies would last, nor the potential additional benefit from the addition of the Verzenio. If I encounter an adverse reaction, we were wondering how long it would take to get back to normal after stopping the Fulvestrant and Verzenio. Finally, we were wondering about the additional benefits of these two medications, as compared to Tamoxifen alone which I have tolerated well in the past.",

We request that Dr Person5 ask for a conversation with the Medical Director of Org9 to explain the need for the rehab stay. I have given more detailed context on this point to Person7. The appeal process and phone number to call is in the attached rejection letter. We believe a peer to peer conversation between physicians might support this application. In add ition we are going to research other facilities to see if there is a different place that might be more likely to get approved.

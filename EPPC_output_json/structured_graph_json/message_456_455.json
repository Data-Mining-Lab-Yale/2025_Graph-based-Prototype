Person2's application for a 2 week Rehab visit at Org9 was rejected by Org9 his insurer. Attached is the rejection letter. This letter explains the process for appeal. We request that Dr Person5 ask for a conversation with the Medical Director of Org9 to explain the need for the rehab stay. I have given more detailed context on this point to Person7. The appeal process and phone number to call is in the attached rejection letter. We believe a peer to peer conversation between physicians might support this application. In add ition we are going to research other facilities to see if there is a different place that might be more likely to get approved. Please let Person2 and I know if you are able to have Dr  Person5 do this for us. If you prefer to call me to discuss my number is XXX-XXX-XXXX. Many thanks",

Going there after each visit is the best way to make sure all get scheduled well in advance. Otherwise the scheduling team does not know you need the appointment. I do have a cancellation for next week if you c an come in on MM/DD/YYYY at 10:00am you can see Dr  Person2 and get your injection. I do see you  have been getting your labs every 8 weeks so there is nothing else you need to do before the appt. I will ask our secretary to schedule but if MM/DD/YYYY is not good for you you can call the office at XXX-XXX-XXXX to reschedule. Thanks Person3 RN",

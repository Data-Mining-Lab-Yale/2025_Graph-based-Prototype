As part of that test, could you also ensure a blood clotting time test is included please. My stomach is a mass of hematoma now as a result of the self injecting and this seems to be happening because my blood is too thin. In speaking with the vascular cardiologist there is also question mark as to whether there really was a partial blood clot in my vein as well. Would love to get back on to the Eliquis if I can. Thanks,  Person2",

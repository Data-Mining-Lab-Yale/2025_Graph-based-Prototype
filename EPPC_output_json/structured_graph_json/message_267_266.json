We would like to move forward with focusing on the treatment plan. Radiation had scheduled 5 days of treatment for next week, that I will be doing. May we get the bone infusion appointments set back up? Also, my pain has increased in the past couple of days. I was taking the oxycodone last week, but they really do make me feel sick after a couple of hours. Is there something else I could try? The Tylenol and Aleve just aren enough right now. I have a prescription for trazodone from Org2 oncology, it was given for treating anxiety? Would this treat the pain temporarily? Thank you, Person1",

Appreciate if you would take a look at the results and let me have your opinion. I interpreting it as early stage throat cancer and presume we are looking at more surgery. They ordered a CT scan of the neck for MM/DD/YYYY and a ENT consultation on MM/DD/YYYY. Am assuming this is my new normal now and that we going to continue to find more of this as time goes by. Seems my immune system is not doing its job at stopping this stuff from occurring? Best regards,  Person2",

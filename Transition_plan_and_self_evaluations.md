# Transition Deliverables and Self-Evaluation (May–October 2025)

This document includes two sections: (1) a structured list of transition items summarizing completed work and materials to be documented or handed over, and (2) an objective self-evaluation comparing the scope of work to standard postdoctoral expectations.

---

## **Part I: Transition Deliverables and Documentation Plan**

### **1. Research and Implementation Artifacts**
- **Code and Pipelines**
  - Full preprocessing and analysis pipeline for clause-level classification.
  - Text-to-graph conversion modules: dependency graph, three SRL graph variants (weighted, predicate, clause-anchored).
  - Graph-based model implementations (GCN, GAT) and error analysis utilities.
  - Scripts for semantic conflict analysis (TF-IDF, LSA, SBERT, Jaccard similarity).
  - Auto-labeling and heuristic annotation tools for the WOVEN dataset.
  - Phrase-splitting and decision-structure pipeline scripts.

- **Data and Reports**
  - Cleaned and processed datasets: intent classification data, WOVEN subsets, Bethesda analysis outputs.
  - Feasibility and data-quality reports (graph abstraction, imbalance, noise, ambiguity).
  - Reduced representative datasets and decision-rule experiment outputs.

- **Documentation**
  - Input/output documentation for each major script and module.
  - Dataset descriptions and data dictionary for WOVEN, Bethesda, and sample sets.
  - `environment.yaml` and dependency setup files.

### **2. Writing and Presentations**
- Workshop paper draft (five graph experiment variants; conclusions on feasibility).
- Two Yale AI Seed Grant proposals (communication and education themes).
- Literature reviews on graph-based NLP abstraction and intent modeling.
- Poster for Yale Postdoc Symposium (hierarchical narrative + healthcare theme).
- Two internal presentations on visual narratives in healthcare and education.

### **3. Conceptual and Analytical Notes**
- Decision-rule induction experiment designs and diagrams.
- Summaries of literature on reverse-engineering noisy labels and ML robustness.
- Notes on intent categorization (interactional vs. goal-oriented).
- Ongoing references and discussion notes for virtual patient and healthcare visualization topics.

### **4. Transition Preparation Tasks (October–November)**
- Compile all deliverables (scripts, datasets, analyses, reports) in shared repository.
- Organize documentation folder with readme and usage instructions.
- Prepare final memo summarizing progress, key findings, and next-step recommendations.
- Verify that all processed data and reports are accessible to the team.

## **Part II: Self-Evaluation and Workload Analysis**

### **Overview**
Between May and October 2025, the work encompassed multiple concurrent research streams, including clause-level graph-based modeling, semantic conflict analysis, dataset design, and visual narrative applications. All assigned and self-initiated duties were completed to a professional standard, and transition documentation is in progress.

### **Workload Evaluation Against Postdoctoral Norms**

| **Category** | **Typical Expectation** | **Documented Work** | **Evaluation** |
|---------------|------------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Research Ideation** | Support PI’s ideas | Conceived and wrote two full proposals independently | Exceeds standard scope |
| **Implementation & Analysis** | Contribute to code or methods | Developed complete pipelines and graph-based models | Above average technical depth |
| **Writing & Documentation** | Co-author papers | Led workshop paper and authored technical reports | Demonstrates lead-author capability |
| **Project Ownership** | Follow assigned direction | Defined subprojects and maintained reusable frameworks | Indicates strong independence |
| **Literature & Presentation** | Contribute to group reviews | Conducted multiple reviews and presented findings | Meets and exceeds expectations |
| **Transition Effort** | Minimal documentation | Comprehensive handover and archiving | Thorough and well-documented |

### **Summary**
- The workload represents a combination of technical, analytical, and conceptual efforts that collectively align with advanced postdoctoral or early independent research expectations.
- Deliverables cover full project life cycles: ideation → implementation → analysis → documentation.
- The transition materials provide continuity for future team work and support transparent project handover.

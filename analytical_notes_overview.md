# AnalyticalNotesAndWritingAndPresentations

This folder contains all analytical notes, proposal drafts, presentation slides, and written materials produced between May–November 2025. It serves as both a working directory for research documentation and an archive of materials relevant to the transition record.

Below is an overview of each subfolder and file.

---

## Folders

### **AI_Seed_Grant/**
Contains materials related to two proposal directions explored during the postdoctoral period:
- **Proposal for Narrative Visual Summarization** – Draft for a narrative-driven visualization system designed to support patient-centered communication.
- **Proposal for Goal-Driven Narrative** – Draft exploring a goal-oriented personalized narrative creation framework.

---

### **Rule_Paper/**
Reference papers and notes supporting the investigation of **rule induction** methods under noisy labels. Includes literature relevant to reverse-engineering annotation policies and understanding label inconsistencies in clinical datasets.

---

### **VN_references/**
Papers presented in internal team meetings related to **visual narrative theory**, interactive storytelling, and multimodal narrative representations.

---

### **2025_Appendix_Data_and_Source_Code/**
Appendix materials and source code used for the graph-based workshop paper draft, including:
- Processed datasets
- Graph construction scripts
- Model implementation code (GCN/GAT)
- Validity checks and experimental utilities

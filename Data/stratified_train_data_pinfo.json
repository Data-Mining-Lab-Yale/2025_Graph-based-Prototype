May we get the bone infusion appointments set back up? Also, my pain has increased in the past couple of days. I was taking the oxycodone last week, but they really do make me feel sick after a couple of hours. Is there something else I could try? The Tylenol and Aleve just aren enough right now. I have a prescription for trazodone from Org2 oncology, it was given for treating anxiety? Would this treat the pain temporarily? Thank you, Person1",

We request that Dr Person5 ask for a conversation with the Medical Director of Org9 to explain the need for the rehab stay. I have given more detailed context on this point to Person7. The appeal process and phone number to call is in the attached rejection letter. We believe a peer to peer conversation between physicians might support this application. In add ition we are going to research other facilities to see if there is a different place that might be more likely to get approved. Please let Person2 and I know if you are able to have Dr Person5 do this for us. If you prefer to call me to discuss my number is XXX-XXX-XXXX. Many thanks",

I think it is worth pointing out that you began the zytiga in MM/DD/YYYY and I have labs from MM/DD/YYYY through MM/DD/YYYY in which the glucose was in the low 100s. I think it is likely that starting the leuprolide/zytiga/prednisone contributed to the high gluc ose level but I doubt that was the primary cause. Having blood sugars in that range is a very rare side effect of these medications though it can happen. That said, I should discuss this in more detail with the folks at the diabetes center at Org2. We should strategize about how to proceed. I will reach out to them this week. Best, Person1",

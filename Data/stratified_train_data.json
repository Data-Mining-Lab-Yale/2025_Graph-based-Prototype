I was happy to see that this was trending down. We do not have a comparison for the CEA, but if this serves us value in the future, we will then have something to look back and compare to. Take care, RDL ----- Message ----- From: Sent: To: Subject: RE: Visit Follow-Up Question Hi Dr Person1, At our last appointment we discussed getting the cancer antigen test at my next blood work. I thought we were doing the CA 27 Dash 29 that I have always had done but no results have come in for that. A test result for CEA came in but I don't know what that is. I have nothing to compare that to although it appears the numbers pretty high which is concerning. I was wondering if there was a reason for switching to a different test? The 27/29 has been a good indicator for me in the past. Thank you",

We request that Dr Person5 ask for a conversation with the Medical Director of Org9 to explain the need for the rehab stay. I have given more detailed context on this point to Person7. The appeal process and phone number to call is in the attached rejection letter. We believe a peer to peer conversation between physicians might support this application. In add ition we are going to research other facilities to see if there is a different place that might be more likely to get approved. Please let Person2 and I know if you are able to have Dr Person5 do this for us. If you prefer to call me to discuss my number is XXX-XXX-XXXX. Many thanks",

Him feeling pain while on the generic is a bit scary for him and all. It shows the generic is not as effective. What can we do at this point to try to continue to get Person1? Does the office have samples he can have for this month? I am calling the johnson & johnson program to see if he qualifies for a reduce rate and will try my options on my end.

The platelet is also the biggest enemy of the cardiologist!! I don't know if there is a compromise solution for me to take 1/2 a dose of interferon that I have been taking or whether we just continue to observe the platelet count until there is a slowing of its rate of rise. Please keep in mind it was generally around 400,000 but of course I was not making any red blood cells either. Thank you so much for looking into this.

Having blood sugars in that range is a very rare side effect of these medications though it can happen. That said, I should discuss this in more detail with the folks at the diabetes center at Org2.

One of the new voluntary roles I have undertaken is calling MICU patients' families to give support and basic medical updates as they are not allowed to be with the admitted family member, many of which are intubated.  It is heartbreaking to speak with some of these families. They are very thankful and appreciative of the care, but want to be at the bedside and provide emotional support to the sick family member.  I can only do so much over the phone.  This is not just the case in the hospital, but for those patients that die, family members cannot even be present then and funerals have changed so much.  Loved ones oftentimes cannot even see the deceased.
Also, while patients are getting outstanding care by all staff, it is good for an advocate to be at bedside, asking questions and getting the most up to date information and to ensure that no errors in aspects of care are made.

However, I have been in contact with colleagues across the nation (I worked in NYC for 10 years prior to this job, which I started last year) and I have heard many upsetting things from close friends about their exposures and experiences with Covid-19, which has contributed to my own anxiety about how we as a society will be able to handle this situation.","I have been very grateful that my organization has made efforts (that were well communicated, which I appreciated) to acquire adequate PPE and train/fit us very quickly in the use of new brands of N95s, PAPRs, etc. Being prepared to safely do my job has been the most reassuring aspect of this, and gives me hope that I will be able to continue working in a way that does not excessively compromise my safety and that of my family.","I am appalled the the disorganized and inadequate response from our federal government to this global crisis. On May 8, 2020, I still can't order a test for Covid-19 on a community-dwelling, non-hospitalized patient at my institution because we haven't been able to source adequate numbers of nasopharyngeal swabs and we refuse to use sub-par oropharyngeal testing, a decision with which I am in agreeement. 

The fact that the federal government has not utilized every resource in its power to quickly and efficiently ramp up testing and contact tracing efforts is an unmitigated travesty and will result in far worse economic effects in our society, while we have to continue to rely on social distancing to manage this infection instead of proactive containment efforts. The fact that we are forced to approach this pandemic in the same exact way as the 1918 influenza pandemic, using public health approaches that are a century old, would be laughable if it weren't so tragic. We need more tests and a robust public health infrastructure to adequately address this crisis, and all the effective local leadership in the world is not going to be able to substitute for that.

As a resident in the inpatient setting, it was frustrating to wait for plans to be created and then disseminated, and to see how a traditionally reactive system that is a massive bureaucracy takes time to respond when rapid change is necessary.  It was additionally quite angering to see disparities between how institutions of different sizes and financial security were more or less able to provide rapid or even in-house COVID testing.","Seeing how our strong inpatient team dynamics and interprofessional relationships, as well as compassionate inter-residency dynamics, have allowed for increased peer support and teamwork during a particularly stressful time, has been both gratifying and inspiring.

Only 1-2 patients per day were being put on precautions and anyone else coming in with respiratory symptoms was treated under normal procedure.  A patient came in for asthma exacerbation x 5 days after her medrol dose pak was not treating her symptoms.  My coworker and I (both pregnant) sent for her to come to the XRay department.  She came wearing a mask improperly.  We xrayed her with only gloves on and sent her back to the ED.  90 minutes later another coworker happened to notice that the patient had a COVID precautions symbol next to her name in the ED Trackboard that had not been in place prior to us performing her exam.  Less than 2 days later that patient was intubated up on the CCU.  

The reason that it was so upsetting was that the experts and professionals that were in charge of implementing the COVID infection control procedures did a terrible job of providing staff with proper procedures and policies.  In addition to that, there were several staff members that were exposed to COVID from this one patient prior to her being deemed a COVID risk.  After that, there was no handoff in communication to notify any of that staff that they had been potentially exposed.

I had taken care of both for 2 weeks.  One was strongly attached to our service and team, young, newly wed, and died a month later in the ICU.  I struggle with feelings of guilt that I abandoned the patient.  I can't bring myself to make a condolence call to his wife.  He told me he knew he was going to die on the day of his transfer; I reassured him to stay strong and think positively.  I can't help but feel like I not only abandoned him, but that I lied to him.  It was a very difficult time, very early on in the first weeks of the pandemic. It also reaffirms some of my career long struggles with the emotional bonds we form with patients and their families - why we connect with some and not with others, why some deaths affect us so profoundly and others don't...  I realize this is perhaps professional and not personal, but it affected me personally.  I suppose the most upsetting thing that has happened personally is just the disparate opinions of the pandemic in my household and a feeling of psychological isolation (but that is nothing new - I've had a 30 year relationship with a spouse who's worldview is radically different from mine). I feel helpless, isolated.  I don't feel hopeless, though.","I really enjoyed bringing families to morning bedside rounds via phone or FaceTime.  It made me and the team feel very connected to the patients and their families.  It allowed me to evaluate how the House Staff informs patients with their family members present of their plan and the pathophysiology of their disease in lay terms.  It helped families stay connected while they couldn't visit personally.  I'd like to keep this practice part of daily rounds going forward.

I'm touched that he cares as much as he does.","Thinks have gotten far better now than they were in the beginning in terms of information and PPE in the workplace.

Its not fair but I feel its the safest option for my husband, myself and any future children I may have. Our state also has laws trying to get rid of abortion and I worry that if I was early in pregnancy, had COVID and terminating the preganancy would save my life that this wouldn't be an option for me which is scary. Due to this pandemic, I am also geographically separated from my in-laws and parents which are both a great sense of support. I have considered that after my contract is up, I will likely move to the same state as my parents as this will help with child care in the future and make even seeing them from a distance more helpful. I would be farther from my in laws but they are adept at using texting and my husband is not quite as close to them as I am with my parents.

I was told last week that the hospital may have us come back to work in the office not because any decline in COVID19 cases has occurred at our hospital, but because of the optics.  I was also told by our clinic manager that our ability to work from home (which is what has most helped me cope with my anxiety) will depend in large part on how long insurance is willing to pay for our services to be from home instead of facility-based.

Our upper management is primarily MBAs so the financial end of things is their focus.

Having someone who does not honor the scientific realities at play but controls what is expected of me as an employee during this pandemic makes me feel taken advantage of, vulnerable, and scared. That said, our clinic management is amazing and we have taken extra care to provide mental health support groups for healthcare workers and their children as well as provide more ""team huddles"" on Zoom for us to congregate as a clinic, shoot the sh!t, and support one another.

Our floor hadn't had many COVID patients previous to this and policies were changing every day - it was overwhelming to try to keep up.

I was in my patient's room with a fellow RT and resident consulting the patient's deteriorating condition. We all had N95+ masks donned at this time, the patient was actively coughing and suctioning secretions. Meanwhile, my manager was outside the room yelling at those entering (the RT and resident now present in the room) that we shouldn't be wasting N95+ masks due to the shortage.

At this time, it was unknown whether the patient had COVID (test was pending) and we were concerned because the patient was actively coughing and suctioning secretions. Also, we were discussing intubating - which an aerosolizing procedure. At that moment, I felt unsafe and belittled for both myself and my coworkers by using the PPE we were thought to be using. I was angry and anxious for the upcoming intubation event that hadn't been performed on my unit with a COVID patient yet, all the while angry and unprotected by my management.

Since that event, I had severe anxiety about whether we were actually being adequately protected with necessary PPE or not.

She is a year older than me (26), and we met as I was her clinical instructor at my previous job. After she graduated, she took a per-diem position within our radiology ultrasound department, and then when I left for my current role at HUP MFM, she filled into my prior position.

She is a first generation American, and lives with her mother, father, adult sister, and younger sister and brother. She contracted COVID19 at work, and subsequently brought it home to everyone in her family except her 4 year old brother. Thankfully everyone is now okay, but the waiting period to get to that point was absolutely awful. Watching an entire family, already scrutinized for the color of their skin, navigate and cope with being infected with this awful disease was absolutely heart breaking. Access to healthcare is not universal, and it could not have been more prevalent than in this situation. What's worse is this entire pandemic I have been so grateful to be at my current role which I started just before, but I cannot even begin to wonder the type of chaos and fear my old co-workers have been dealing with. This was a fear realized. She had literally no support or guidance, and still doesn't, by her healthcare network as an employee infected at work.

Sonographers already spend a very long amount of time in very close proximity to patients, having to touch them from head to toe. Most of my fellow sonographers across the country I am sure could attest to the fact that protocols have not been limited to lessen exposure time, in addition to the fact that often in radiology settings orders are placed for patients through the ED who end up testing positive shortly later, though songrpahers scan them prior without proper PPE as often the information we actually receive about patients is very limited.

I know my friend scanned multiple patients that later ended up testing as Covid19 positive.

This has made me feel hopeless, unheard, and fearfu","So many of my friends and loved ones have made an effort to thank me for the work that I am doing.

1) A covid patient of mine in the ICU quickly began decompensating to extremis and I was told not to enter the room (the fellow entered, but as a resident I was to stay outside), the nurse pulled the curtain and I was forced to stand on tables to see what was happening with my patient. I felt completely helpless, worthless, and full of hopeless anxiety. I felt that I had no skills to provide to the situation. I had no value. Zero. Even for the most menial of things. We decided to administer stress dose steroids, there was no nurse around me except the one inside the room, and I can't override medications in the pixis, so I just paced back and forth looking for a nurse to pull the medications. Completely useless while my patient was in extremis. One of the worst feelings of my residency. A completely different feeling than earlier years when maybe I didnt have the knowledge to help a patient in extremis.. This, I just had no value. 

2) A covid patient of mine in the ICU who had been successfully extubated, and was felt to be improving, began slowly decompensating over about 3 days with increased oxygen requirements, secretions that were difficult to manage, and an impossibly weak cough after being intubated for 3 weeks. But the hospital policy was to not allow deep suctioning of covid patients. I spent 48hrs talking to everyone I could find--respiratory therapists, nurse managers, attendings, other residents--to see what work around there was because if we didnt start suctioning, he was going to develop a mucus plug and die suddenly. The exact same scenario happened with another of my covid patients who wasnt able to be suctioned after extubation and we watched him die. I didnt want that to happen again. I couldnt watch another patient die because of a strict restriction on simple life saving techniques like suctioning.

Right before my surgery, I met with my surgeon and she had no recollection of our visit the previous week. I asked to be admitted after my surgery, if possible, because I had limited support in the home. Instead, I was discharged 1.5 hours after my surgery, while I was still delirious and incredibly nauseous. I was not given anti-nausea medications until several days afterwards when I reached out to the doctor and informed her I could not even drink water or take painkillers. My in-person post-op appointment was canceled and rescheduled to a teletherapy appointment. I've had lots of pain/complications since the surgery and no one examined me in person until 5 months later when my PCP returned from medical leave. I know that these are COVID times, and perhaps my surgeon has been impacted in some ways as well, but medical care during this time was scary, frustrated, and sub-par. I've felt frustrated, ANGRY, and unimportant during this time.","During this time, my boyfriend and I have found that we can tolerate being together 24/7 which I imagine is really hard to do outside of these times. We were living in a 350sq ft studio and moved to 1200 sq ft 1 bedroom so we could work from home comfortably. We were able to do this because rent had dropped in San Francisco. We feel blessed to have a place to stay, our jobs, and each other.","My surgery made being outside much harder. We were hiking 3-8 hours a week before my procedure, and now I'm so weak that this coping skill is not as viable an option. (We now go for REALLY long drives, step out of the car briefly for photos, then drive home). I work until 6-7pm nightly and have no energy to go for a walk after work (also, it's dark). I was off of work for 6 weeks and in September-October, things were going well with my patients. However, I definitely felt a shift in myself and my patients starting in November. I work with parents who have children with ADHD and this population has been struggling SO much with distance learning. My partner and I are also being very safe and have only briefly met with a 1-3 friends during this time. Only for a brief visit, and always outside. The impact of my job, my health, my pain, and this isolation on me has led to this burn-out that I am experiencing now.",2.0,,

I am looking forward to being able to travel again and get the heck out of here. I suppose one positive, slightly hopeful event was being able to pay off a few small student loans during the pandemic. That's it.","This pandemic (this year) has illuminated the unfortunate effects of politics interfering with health and the devastating lack of education we have as a nation regarding the importance of public health and epidemiology. Clearly our emphasis on public health is just about as bad as (our lack of) sexual health education. I think one takeaway should be adding an age-appropriate school lesson for all ages to discuss hand hygiene, bacteria and virus transmission, and the rationale and science behind public health interventions (including vaccines). This shouldn't be political. Health, illness and death are commonalities among all individuals. Education to prevent illness and preventable death shouldn't be political either. Lastly, my perception is that people/patients have gotten more rude, entitled, and demanding during this pandemic, and though I do acknowledge the financial and social stressors people are enduring, their expression of their frustration has been quite counterproductive in attacking those who are working tirelessly every day to provide health care and promote science to end this pandemic. To conclude, I'm quite disgusted, as my aforementioned comments here have expressed. Providing care to patients under stressful circumstances in which you are putting your own health the health of your families at risk is one thing. This is what we signed up for, and we take our work seriously and to heart.

For example, resident workroom ran out of Sani-wipes, I attempted to ask the nurse for another bottle and was berated and told that we wouldn't get wipes from them. Since I was working overnight, I had to wait until the morning until the chief came in to request a new bottle of sani wipes. I attempted to ask other nurses, but they all refrained from helping to give me sani-wipes (turned a blind eye).

Another scenario, no access to proper N95 masks. I wear small N95 and we ran out of this size. The P100 makes it too challenging to communicate to attendings during emergent situations (e.g. intubations) and so, I wore the regular N95 for over a month while waiting for small. I didn't have access to small until I had to special request it from the front desk and even then, it was kept locked up. So overnight, if my mask was no longer usable, I wouldn't have access to replacing it. 

To this day, there are no hand sanitizer bottles for anesthesia workstations in the OR. Some ORs will have an automatic dispenser next to the anesthesia machine, but this isn't the case for all ORs. 

These situations are a few of the most upsetting aspects to the pandemic– lack of PPE or even easy access to PPE.",The most hopeful was the restructuring of medicine COVID rotations to 4 on and 3 off.

I was an OB/GYN resident for 3 years, developed debilitating anxiety and depression in February 2020, quit my job right before the pandemic, and am currently working as a research coordinator while applying for psychiatry residencies. I am a competitive applicant, but have gotten very few interviews. I have been most upset by my lack of opportunities, and somehow reason that because of COVID, I was unemployed for a long time, unable to get a timely letter of recommendation from a psychiatrist, and unable to secure residency interviews. I do not regret leaving OB/GYN, but the lack of interview offers and rejections has made me feel like a failure occasionally. I offered to work as a healthcare provider during the initial phase of the pandemic, but my supervisors believed it would harm my mental health to work, as I grieved the loss of my identity as an OB/GYN. I felt useless as a healthcare provider, and this affected my self-worth for a few months in May-August. I was very sad, but relying on years of coping strategies to continue being functional.","Gaining employment. I was unemployed from May to October of this year. Although I now work in clinical research and miss being a physician, I am grateful for the time to process and recover from my recent career change. Working helped me re-direct my goals and avoid ruminating on my perceived failure for not being ""strong enough"" to handle a challenging surgical residency. I am now looking forward to my new career as a psychiatrist, but my residency rejection letters, has caused me to cast doubt on my value as a physician, which is often unfortunately tied to my value as a person. In October, after securing a full-time job in an area of interest (my lab also studies pandemic-related stress!) changed my feelings towards myself. I became more hopeful and optimistic that I can have other achievements and not ruminate on my failures","I am an oddball in that I appreciated the social isolation aspect.

The co-worker who attacked has a history of lashing out. She verbally lashed out at me after the assault. The co-worker who was assaulted took 3 months medical leave to cope with the mental and physical trauma. The co-worker who assaulted her was allowed to return to work within two days.

The assaulting co-worker a month or so later mocked a patient in report for their gender identity and sexual orientation. When I defended the patient, the co-worker asked me to disclose my own gender identity and sexual orientation, attempting to gain ground for laughing at the patient, who identified as a demi-boy. I'm pansexual.

In both the physical assault and the verbal attacks, my managers defended the offending person, and ignored the incidents. I feel afraid. I can't trust my managers. Depending on the night, I fear for my safety and my patients'. Trying to keep others safe in the pandemic, I feel deeply isolated.

But there were so many before Floyd. And issuing a statement and “promising to be better going forward” does little to acknowledge each institutions complicity before that sentinel event, OR to admit just how unprepared they were to change the micro cultures that are still going to exist despite the C suites (in healthcare and all other fields) sending out a PR email saying Black Lives Matter. So it makes it HARDER to seek accountability because now institutions can say “wait, whoa whoa we’re doing something. What do you mean we are still racist.” So I’ve dealt with a lot of the feelings of anger due to what feels like a cop-out and quick, easy “fix” to a problem that existed long before 2020 and will continue to exist. 

The most upsetting part is that being a “silent radical” as I call it (keeping one’s head down to get THROUGH the parts where how one is perceived determines one’s success in their career) seems to not be enough anymore, though I doubt institutions are actually ready for us to be vocal with all of our grievances because they are numerous, we just remain silent about them because the few that we do determine are bad enough to bring forth aren’t even fully rectified, so it seems like there aren’t many more where those few came from. We just knew it was a moot point, and the sad thing is they’re still going to be a moot point because at the end of the day institutions aren’t REALLY ready to change. They don’t even know what that change would entail.",Being accepted and nurtured by a majority of the colleagues in the specialty of choice I am pursuing as an MS4,"I wanted to also include that it was very upsetting that, once the numbers started to show that black and brown people were over represented in the COVID mortality rate, it felt like THAT was when the majority of white anti-maskers determined they didn’t have to wear a mask or adhere to social distancing precautions, because it wasn’t as bad for them or their loved ones. The disproportionate number of POC killed by the virus is devastating.",2.0,,

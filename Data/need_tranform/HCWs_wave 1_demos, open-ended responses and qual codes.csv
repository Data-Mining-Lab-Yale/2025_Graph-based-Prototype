My attending and I weren’t able to intubate him because of the blood. The code team refused to stop chest compressions so we could have a better view. My shield and surgical mask fell into the field (I was still wearing an N95). ENT or trauma surgery is not currently responding to emergent surgical airway calls. After the code was called and the patient was pronounced dead I was covered in his blood. I had to rush back down to the OR because I got paged that a stroke code was coming in. The OR was busy the entire evening. I showered in the anesthesia showers (no soap, so I used chlorhexidine in my hair and on my body). No clean towels so I used paper towels. Shower is covered in grime and I didn’t have shower shoes - so I wore my home shoes in the shower. The following day I came home and cried. I then receive a phone call from a different attending in my department saying he would have done things differently, asked me why I didn’t attempt a surgical airway, and pimped me about the indications for a surgical airway. My first feeling was incompetence. I felt inadequate, ill equipped, unintelligent, and small. The best part was this attending didn’t call the attending I was with during the code to discuss management - he just called me. Not a single superior called me to make sure I was emotionally okay.","Appreciation for fresh air. My husband and I are both Anesthesia residents.

Seeing the ED physician in NYC take her life was upsetting and makes me feel less secure about the future with colleagues having PTSD or resulting emotional challenges to work through. I worry we're not prepared as a country or health care system to be kind and care for these people who have been traumatized. The way NYC was pretty much left to fend for itself in such an under resourced fashion is also upsetting. 
The most upsetting things to me have been the US government response for our own preparedness but also our country's dismissive response to the global response of collaboration to the pandemic. Friends from around the world in large and small and low income/high income countries have been concerned about us. We should be leading and be an example. 
I also sense a tension in the academic sphere of people rushing to publish and study everything COVID which is important, but many of these people aren't front line workers. It seems exploitative or predatory, even within Yale.

I had SOB for a week or 2 and didn’t get tested because of lack of fever (this was in early March). 

I felt nothing would be done unless I was severely ill, which made me concerned, scared and hopeless. As someone who had severe asthma growing up and who survived varicella PNA at 20 years of age, I know what it feels like to not be able to breath, be at the brink of getting intubated while seeing your parents in tears and being isolated in a SDU room for 2 weeks. 

I worried for myself, I am alone here, but also for my parents. Who would help them if I’m sick or gone? Would they fly up here from FL? That’s dangerous too! On top of that having to hide your fear and be strong for them also took a toll. And then you think about your patients. What if I DO have this... I’m still going to work, it’s highly contagious, etc. 

Overall it’s been OK, most days are good.

Got back in touch with med school friends I hadn’t talked to in years. Received masks from a total stranger. Saw all the love and support that the majority of people have for one another.  

It makes me feel hopeful, optimistic, that there’s more good people than not, and that when society unites, and works as one towards a common goal, beautiful things happen. Look at NYC, look at YNHH... amongst all deaths and horrible things, we have stories of love and support, and we’ve flattened the curve. We just have to put our minds and souls to it and think about how our actions affect others. It makes me feel we will get through this.","I’m very proud to see how specialties have left their “unspoken differences” aside and are working together to fight this pandemic.

One of the new voluntary roles I have undertaken is calling MICU patients' families to give support and basic medical updates as they are not allowed to be with the admitted family member, many of which are intubated.  It is heartbreaking to speak with some of these families. They are very thankful and appreciative of the care, but want to be at the bedside and provide emotional support to the sick family member.  I can only do so much over the phone.  This is not just the case in the hospital, but for those patients that die, family members cannot even be present then and funerals have changed so much.  Loved ones oftentimes cannot even see the deceased.
Also, while patients are getting outstanding care by all staff, it is good for an advocate to be at bedside, asking questions and getting the most up to date information and to ensure that no errors in aspects of care are made.
This lack of visitation makes me feel awful and helpless and while I understand why the policies are implemented, I feel the stress level for families for having a loved one in the hospital is much higher than during ""normal"" times.","Just seeing the trend of cases and hospitalizations in the northeast USA leveling out and downtrending is reassuring.  It makes me hopeful that while the end may not totally be in sight, we are headed in the right direction.

I was supposed to be getting training on the inpatient unit, but instead I felt like the charge nurse of that unit was rushing me to get my own assignment and I was already uncomfortable in such an unfamiliar environment. I've never worked on a medicine inpatient unit and I've never experienced dealing with patients dying. Aside from dealing with the stress of that charge nurse and an unfamiliar environment, I was having a panic attack after having to wear an N95 mask for long period of time. So I ended up having to leave and got reassigned to a non-COVID unit. Once I left that unit that day, I remember crying and being completely out of it. I went to my car and then I had to call my therapist and do an emergency phone session with him because I was losing my mind with the mix of being thrown onto a unit with situations I've never worked around in my entire life and being uncomfortable with not being able to breathe.",The most positive thing that has happened was being able to get my mental health under control and being able to work in an environment that is suitable for me.,"n/a

With regard to most upsetting part of working with COVID-19 patients, I cannot get the image of my young son (4 years old) running towards me to hug me after coming home from my shift when the pandemic first hit my hospital.  I yelled at him to stay away and my husband had to run and grab him.  The look of sheer confusion and disappointment on his face has stayed with me all of these weeks.  I cannot get that image out of my head.  He now understands I need to shower before hugging him.","Seeing the outpouring of support from the community has been amazing.  I am typically a school nurse who only works per diem in labor and delivery (typically one weekend a month and summers).  I have been working exponentially more shifts since March.

People that are making decisions are not actually doing the work and seeing the time it takes to do properly - staffing ratios are not being adjusted. Variations in rules between hospitals is also quite frustrating - staff being confused when they work multiple places. And patients being confused based on what they've heard from friends/family.

I think the most upsetting thing was I felt unprepared and not trained (as it was on the job training) There is a lot of grey area with decision making as things are rapidly changing.  During one time a patient lied about being COVID + and if I hadn't asked a few more questions prior to letting the pt go in for her apt she would have been in the entire building.  For precaution after that I spent 7 days away from my son and family.  But it was at that time I realized how much weight had been placed on our shoulders.,"I think overall being able to lessen others stress and anxiety has been a great experience.  It is not one specific situation, but many that I feel that by calmly and kindly talking to patients about process we are doing at Yale to protect them and also seeing others I work with do the same is great.  Our Old Saybrook team is one of a kind and I feel very lucky to work with such a dynamic group.","Overall I think the hospital is doing a great job.

However, I have been in contact with colleagues across the nation (I worked in NYC for 10 years prior to this job, which I started last year) and I have heard many upsetting things from close friends about their exposures and experiences with Covid-19, which has contributed to my own anxiety about how we as a society will be able to handle this situation.","I have been very grateful that my organization has made efforts (that were well communicated, which I appreciated) to acquire adequate PPE and train/fit us very quickly in the use of new brands of N95s, PAPRs, etc. Being prepared to safely do my job has been the most reassuring aspect of this, and gives me hope that I will be able to continue working in a way that does not excessively compromise my safety and that of my family.","I am appalled the the disorganized and inadequate response from our federal government to this global crisis. On May 8, 2020, I still can't order a test for Covid-19 on a community-dwelling, non-hospitalized patient at my institution because we haven't been able to source adequate numbers of nasopharyngeal swabs and we refuse to use sub-par oropharyngeal testing, a decision with which I am in agreeement. 

The fact that the federal government has not utilized every resource in its power to quickly and efficiently ramp up testing and contact tracing efforts is an unmitigated travesty and will result in far worse economic effects in our society, while we have to continue to rely on social distancing to manage this infection instead of proactive containment efforts. The fact that we are forced to approach this pandemic in the same exact way as the 1918 influenza pandemic, using public health approaches that are a century old, would be laughable if it weren't so tragic. We need more tests and a robust public health infrastructure to adequately address this crisis, and all the effective local leadership in the world is not going to be able to substitute for that.

He didn’t have any other symptoms or fever.  The surgeon was okay proceeding with the case, and I brought it up to my manager that I wanted to have full PPE (PAPR or N95) for this case because we did not know the covid status of this newly symptomatic patient. The issue was brought all the way up to the chairs of anesthesia and ENT, and they decided that it was okay to proceed with standard PPE. I was not comfortable with this at all, and asked to be taken off the case. Just a couple of days later, the hospital implemented a policy where staff taking care of any patient undergoing an aerosol generating procedure would have to don full PPE, and I honestly felt cheated/short-changed in that they were completely okay sending staff into a high risk procedure without full protection only a few days prior.",The most positive thing is being surrounded by colleagues who understand my feelings.,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I had already met with my leadership team, dropped my hours and was in the process of arranging a sabbatical when COVID happened. Because of a drop in ED volume, my hours dropped even more, I was allowed more time at home with my kids and away from the hospital. I had struggled for three years following my second divorce. My second wife was a nurse who, as I've mentioned, devolved into a life of drugs and alcohol on top of crippling untreated mental illness, hitting rock-bottom coincident with the COVID pandemic. I tried helping her as best I could during the three years since our marriage ended, but in the end, she pushed me and the rest of her family away. At this point, she's lost her house, her nursing license and her kids. In the meantime, in addition to my kids, I take care of my equally mentally feeble mother, with a slew of medical comorbidities including lung cancer. She's been living with  us for two of these past two years. Our relationship isn't good, but I'm her only relative in this country, and feel obligated to help. 
I'm constantly surrounded by work and work-related things.

I was in need of help, in need of a break before this all started. September was to be my month to take off and collect myself, regroup, and decide how I wanted to proceed in my life and my career. But now it seems that that opportunity has all but evaporated. Meanwhile, I've swallowed down all that hurts me, yet again, and continue to power through my days without missing a beat.

As a resident in the inpatient setting, it was frustrating to wait for plans to be created and then disseminated, and to see how a traditionally reactive system that is a massive bureaucracy takes time to respond when rapid change is necessary.  It was additionally quite angering to see disparities between how institutions of different sizes and financial security were more or less able to provide rapid or even in-house COVID testing.","Seeing how our strong inpatient team dynamics and interprofessional relationships, as well as compassionate inter-residency dynamics, have allowed for increased peer support and teamwork during a particularly stressful time, has been both gratifying and inspiring.

Obviously the loss of patients and the disconnect from their families is horrible, but I truly feel like the bedside nurses are doing an excellent job of taking care of the patients and their loved ones, as they always do during end-of-life in our ICU.  For me personally, probably feeling torn between my strong relationship with the bedside nurses, and now being in a management role.  Working long extra hours, and giving 200% to make sure everyone is safe, informed and appreciated, but seeing constant negative social media posts from staff members, online petitions about poor working conditions and anti-establishment/administration media.  I realize that people are likely referring to upper level corporate leadership, but it is hard not to take it personally when staff discuss concerns about ""management"".  My priority is taking care of the patients, but now my role is also to oversee the staff (who are also still my close friends), and I am doing everything possible to make sure everyone has what they need, so to hear that they do not feel supported or safe makes me feel like I am failing at my job.","(I drink alcohol less often because I worry about needing to come in at any time to assist with staffing the unit)

The community support has been positive, although it doesn't really feel like it is for me, it is meant for the bedside staff.","I feel like there was initially a surge of people jumping in to the cause, signing up for OT, coming to work from other units.  I worry that as this becomes what now seems like an inevitably longer crisis, those staff are going to become burnt out, and our issues with things like staffing and supplies will actually get worse, not better.  I fear that we are just beginning, and I don't know if staff or myself have the resiliency to continue working at this level for an extended period of time.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

So I have known my patients quite well and they have been very sick.  Once day I noticed one of my patients on a ventilator looked horrible the way he was breathing (he was gasping).  The doctors just started to round on him.  He was still on very high vent settings and I asked if they were coming down on his sedation and the nurse basically bit my head off stating that ""we can't keep these patients sedated forever and that he was coughing"" She was wrong he was not coughing he was gasping.  The doctors agreed he needed more sedation.  Then the entire day she was to be blunt a ""bitch"" to me.  These patients are extremely ill and I know my job being in Respiratory and she had no business trying to do mine.  She was rude the entire day to me because I spoke up for the patient.  We should not have to put up with this type of behavior ever.  I spoke to my manager and supervisor, but to be honest she is the type of person if you say something to her it will not matter she will not change the way she acts.","I just feel blessed on how the community has come together and helped out with everything from food, masks, caps.","I think overall, my co-workers have tried to help out and everyone seems to be very understanding.

Only 1-2 patients per day were being put on precautions and anyone else coming in with respiratory symptoms was treated under normal procedure.  A patient came in for asthma exacerbation x 5 days after her medrol dose pak was not treating her symptoms.  My coworker and I (both pregnant) sent for her to come to the XRay department.  She came wearing a mask improperly.  We xrayed her with only gloves on and sent her back to the ED.  90 minutes later another coworker happened to notice that the patient had a COVID precautions symbol next to her name in the ED Trackboard that had not been in place prior to us performing her exam.  Less than 2 days later that patient was intubated up on the CCU.  

The reason that it was so upsetting was that the experts and professionals that were in charge of implementing the COVID infection control procedures did a terrible job of providing staff with proper procedures and policies.  In addition to that, there were several staff members that were exposed to COVID from this one patient prior to her being deemed a COVID risk.  After that, there was no handoff in communication to notify any of that staff that they had been potentially exposed. Not only had our health been put at risk but I had to take time out of caring for patients to call and email my supervisor, the Command Center, Employee Health, the transportation department, and the transportation department manager.",I went for a walk on my lunch break one day and someone pulled their car over to thank me for working during this outbreak.

In this middle of a health care crisis, we are all going bankrupt, laying off workers, taking pay cuts. Society says they appreciate us, but I'm bitter that what is see is my colleagues laid off, and my pay cut, despite a dramatic increase in hours worked. Society says they appreciate health care workers, but yet, we are NOT supported. Our federal government needed to step in to insure everyone in the country had access to the same protocols, treatments, and care without health care workers having to be laid off, pay cut, and working many more hours and taking many more risks. Treating us like this is deplorable. If people truly cared about us, they would recognize that this isn't about politics, its about taking care of each other, and health care workers are not being taken care of by society.

Nurses have empathy and nurses are advocates for their patients. This has never been so apparent. When I see my Covid patients, I am the only person they will see on my entire shift face to face. I then give report to the next nurse and that nurse will be the only healthcare provider that the patient sees face to face. Patients cannot have family members visit. Doctors rarely go in the covid rooms and oftentimes video conference with the patient if they need to speak to or see them. Oftentimes these doctors are doing this from home and are not present in the hospital. Housekeepers do not go in the rooms, nursing empties trash and linen carts now. Dietary does not go in the rooms, nurses now deliver patient's meals. Transport staff do not go in patient rooms, it is the nurse's responsibility to get the patient safely to the stretcher.

I had taken care of both for 2 weeks.  One was strongly attached to our service and team, young, newly wed, and died a month later in the ICU.  I struggle with feelings of guilt that I abandoned the patient.  I can't bring myself to make a condolence call to his wife.  He told me he knew he was going to die on the day of his transfer; I reassured him to stay strong and think positively.  I can't help but feel like I not only abandoned him, but that I lied to him.  It was a very difficult time, very early on in the first weeks of the pandemic. It also reaffirms some of my career long struggles with the emotional bonds we form with patients and their families - why we connect with some and not with others, why some deaths affect us so profoundly and others don't...  I realize this is perhaps professional and not personal, but it affected me personally.  I suppose the most upsetting thing that has happened personally is just the disparate opinions of the pandemic in my household and a feeling of psychological isolation (but that is nothing new - I've had a 30 year relationship with a spouse who's worldview is radically different from mine). I feel helpless, isolated.  I don't feel hopeless, though.","I really enjoyed bringing families to morning bedside rounds via phone or FaceTime.  It made me and the team feel very connected to the patients and their families.  It allowed me to evaluate how the House Staff informs patients with their family members present of their plan and the pathophysiology of their disease in lay terms.  It helped families stay connected while they couldn't visit personally.  I'd like to keep this practice part of daily rounds going forward.

I have a colleague who checks in with me every day.  It's nice to see his text every day.  I'm touched that he cares as much as he does.","Thinks have gotten far better now than they were in the beginning in terms of information and PPE in the workplace.

Anesthesia was focused on wearing N95s, but no one else in the room was. We were getting conflicting answers from the managers/administration about how to be safe in the operating room for all patients. It was very frustrating to be told to  conserve PPE, and watch other team members waste it because they didn't care. And continue to talk about their anxieties and spread them to others - rather than support each other, it just added fuel to the fire. Once a formal decision and policy was put in place, it was much easier.","I got redeployed to the testing center - great team to work with, already had been established guidelines. Very positive environment and supportive. Also rewarding to interact and help so many nervous patients each day.","In talking to other departments, it is a challenge to understand which patients fall under what category, and when you travel to another department - their procedures may not match yours, causing unneccessary stress between staff. (i.e. patient went STAT  to OR with COVID test pending for nursing home - floor treated patient without special precautions. OR treated patient as PUI and therefore berated transport staff with patient for not wearing PPE - made them wait as patient was bleeding out to come to OR. - Lack of clear communication and guidance.)",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

You can see them from the window as you walk in to the hospital. I'm certain it was a childlife activity but I treasured it. Each floor (12 floors) made different signs - one was spelling happy messages out in Post-It notes. It was somehow a sign of solidarity : thank you, we are here, we are thankful you are here, and you make an impact. Clinical research has had a rough go of it and we are constantly pivoting. We have to fight to keep pediatric and adult trials open on our campus - and all the contingency plans. I have had to create and adapt all those plans and get them FDA approved. It made it worth it.","Our hospital - like many others - had some work from home to reduce foot traffic. This was for about 6 weeks. I was one of those that was asked to work from home (as I could).

In March, as the pandemic in the US was rapidly worsening, we made the difficulty decision to live separately from our 2 year old son and my mother, who helps us take care of him. We were unable to provide for his childcare on our own since we were both working, and we felt very worried about transmitting the coronavirus to my mother, who is in her late 60s. It has been devastating to live apart from him: As residents and parents, we’ve spent the last two years trying to optimize every free minute with our son. In normal times, I worry constantly about being an adequate parent. Now, I fear that his security in knowing he is loved and the bonds we’ve worked so hard to foster are being broken down by this time apart.","I have felt well-supported by the leadership in our department - the chief residents, program directors, program administrators, departmental leadership - and I have found the communication from the leadership of internal medicine to be transparent (even if sometimes excessive in volume).

I was so worried that I had it and would infect my family.  I moved out of my house for several weeks after that, and I called my sister and made sure she is still ok with taking care of my kids if my husband and I both die.  I feel morally conflicted that I have a duty to take care of patients but that duty is putting my husband and kids at risk, and I have a duty to protect them too.  I can't do both.","My extended family has been calling/facetiming frequently and many have told me specifically how much they support me and love me, which helps me feel less hopeless.","The way these patients get sick and die is depressing and terrifying.  They're so alone, and scared, it's a terrible way for anyone to die. They come in to the ED and they never see their family again.  The last faces they see are obscured by masks and goggles, and the nurses and doctors rarely even go in the room because they're trying to limit their own exposure.  It's heartbreaking.  Many ""standard"" treatments are denied to these patients because the providers are worried about their own exposure.  I'm morally conflicted about the standard of care the COVID patients receive.   
I spend a lot of time trying to see the big picture, realizing that this will eventually pass and most of us will be ok.  I remind myself that my own chances of severe illness and death, and more importantly those of my immediate family, are low.  Now that I have moved back home, I find joy in the time I get to spend with my family; it is more precious to me for the knowledge that it could all be taken away.  I remind myself how thankful I am that I have a well-paying job and the financial means to come through this epidemic.  And I find comfort in knowing that I can make a difference, I can take care of my patients and find meaning in my work.  I also find it mentally reassuring and stabilizing to go to work and interact with colleagues and not be stuck at home all day; I've been able to retain a modicum of normalcy in going to work every day that many people don't have.

I normally live with just my father and we get along great. I don't get along with my mom, so the fact that she traveled back to quarantine with us was incredibly burdensome, especially because she should have stayed put with other family members. She's a very difficult person with mental health issues (depression and alcoholism), so having her in the same house has upped my stress levels on top of all the extra stress of working on a ""Covid Floor"" at the hospital. I've moved to a room in the basement to be as far away from her as possible (and also to social distance from my parents in general), but it's not enough space to get away from her toxic personality. I tried to find a temporary apartment room, but I don't have the funds to afford it at this time. My other job (non-hospital job) was cut, so my only income is my MICU job, which is only 20 hours a week. Going through a pandemic is hard enough--going through it with her in the house is harder. I wish it wasn't the case, but I can't change things.","I've had more time to delve into home projects because my other job was cut. Lots of home decorating, cooking, baking, and reading! I talk with family members of Covid patients all day on the unit (since visitors aren't allowed in the hospital), so I have a great perspective on how lucky I am to be healthy, have healthy family members, and not feel distanced from what is actually happening with the pandemic. I'm grateful that my family is safe, especially because I've seen a couple Covid deaths over the past month that shed light on how bad this really is/can be.","I'm proud to work in the MICU and be a useful member of society during this time. I've only worked on the unit for 6 months, so this is quite an introduction to working in this vein of healthcare. My job has actually been very grounding for me--if I wasn't going in each week and seeing what Covid what actually doing to patients, I might feel more anxious or scared because I wasn't ""in the loop"" about how the virus affects people. But I am in the loop. I'm there on the floor, able to see the Covid patients with my own eyes and watch the docs and nurses take care of them and help them improve. If I didn't have the stress of my mom living in the house, I think I would be just fine. It's the upheaval of my once-serene home life that has stressed me out, not working in the hospital or fearing contracting the virus myself.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

He did well while I was on so I had a little hope but knew based on the timing of his disease this was likely the mild rally we see before declining. I cried that day out of a feeling of hopelessness. He wanted non-invasive ventilation if needed but DNR/DNI and I knew our respiratory therapists were scared of non-invasive ventilation despite everyone wearing a PAPR and being in a negative pressure room and our hospitals official stance that we could use CPAP/BIPAP if there was another reason besides just COVID (such as his neuromuscular disease which we already knew and ICU physicians agreed with this plan). I worked hard to try and go up the chain and directly talk with the respiratory therapists as I felt he would need non-invasive eventually. Found out after I rotated off service he worsened and had to be transferred to another facility as our respiratory therapists wouldn't do it despite all these safeguards. He was facing long term nursing home with or without COVID and had poor outcomes and I had had multiple conversation with him about this but it was sad that he went through a transfer before going hospice though our policy was it was OK to use CPAP/BIPAP in the negative pressure rooms.,Connecting with friends in other states via online chat options because I and they had more down time when not working.,"I appreciated our hospitalist leadership thinking about our mental health in Feburary and March and as we were ramping up, I was able to say no to volunteering as my husband and I were trying for a child and I was not sure if I was pregnant or not. I grieved for almost a month about the loss of this opportunity because I know as a hospitalist I will be interacting with COVID patients more than most and have decided to delay trying for a child. Its not fair but I feel its the safest option for my husband, myself and any future children I may have. Our state also has laws trying to get rid of abortion and I worry that if I was early in pregnancy, had COVID and terminating the preganancy would save my life that this wouldn't be an option for me which is scary. Due to this pandemic, I am also geographically separated from my in-laws and parents which are both a great sense of support. I have considered that after my contract is up, I will likely move to the same state as my parents as this will help with child care in the future and make even seeing them from a distance more helpful. I would be farther from my in laws but they are adept at using texting and my husband is not quite as close to them as I am with my parents. I have also seen my home state take better public health response to COVID 19 and while I know our hospital took a great stance early, I am quite concerned about our governor opening up the state despite the majority of the state continuing to have outbreaks unlike my home state.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I was told last week that the hospital may have us come back to work in the office not because any decline in COVID19 cases has occurred at our hospital, but because of the optics.  I was also told by our clinic manager that our ability to work from home (which is what has most helped me cope with my anxiety) will depend in large part on how long insurance is willing to pay for our services to be from home instead of facility-based.  My husband is a Navy psychologist so he is working with patients in-person at the Navy hospital every day still and could be deployed if this becomes more severe.  I worry that between my husband seeing patients and my potentially needing to return to the office, that our children are far more likely to get COVID19 and that we will need to resort to childcare options that will further increase their exposure simply because our friends and family are too afraid to be near us since my husband sees patients in-person.  We do not have any friends or family who are NOT working from home at this time.  I worry that I will need to choose between starting my postdoc in September or keeping my family safe as waves of this virus continue due to poor national responses to this pandemic.  I do not want to put my children at risk just so I can go to work when I am working effectively from home.  My attendance rate and productivity (and effectiveness) have actually increased working from home (because I'm putting in a lot more effort and hours to justify working from home) and I feel taken for granted, hurt, vulnerable, and angry that on top of being apart from all my family and friends, missing graduation and in-person defense of my PhD, and cancelling our first vacation in years as a family, the VP and higher up management of the hospital could put my health at risk simply because they feel it would look better for us to all be in the office or because one or","I have felt tremendous gratitude to be able to work from home at this time.  I feel fortunate for job security and the opportunity to finally finish my degree so, despite lockdown, I can still move on professionally and provide for my family.  While I am upset with the highest up management at the hospital, I love my coworkers, supervisor, and clinic manager and I am very grateful for them. &lt;3  I'm grateful for our home, nice neighborhood, and big lawn so quarantine does not feel that limiting.","I would love to see more healthcare professionals in upper management.  Our upper management is primarily MBAs so the financial end of things is their focus.  They then make decisions about how to best weather a pandemic without the science background that the rest of us have.  We are all mindful of the science behind this pandemic and that informs our concerns and how we want to work and interact with patients.  Having someone who does not honor the scientific realities at play but controls what is expected of me as an employee during this pandemic makes me feel taken advantage of, vulnerable, and scared. That said, our clinic management is amazing and we have taken extra care to provide mental health support groups for healthcare workers and their children as well as provide more ""team huddles"" on Zoom for us to congregate as a clinic, shoot the sh!t, and support one another.  It makes me feel like I am not alone as I go through this working from my little home office.  I am also SO grateful to have a home office so I can work in a quiet, secure place that ensures confidentiality.  I have some colleagues who are going into the office because they do not feel comfortable offering services from home given a lack of quiet office space. Thank you for conducting this study!

Watching her parents was heartbreaking, we do not allow visitors unless the patient is actively dying or already deceased.  We are too busy with patient care to give family members the attention they require for support. In the beginning, they only saw their loved one dropped at the hospital and then dead or dying.  We are trying to do video visits but again it must be terrifying for them to see their loved one proned and intubated. I like to do the video calls it helps to reconnect and give purpose to my work. 
It is terrible that they cannot visit.  I can see the staff getting frustrated with families for calling so frequently.  
This disease seems to kill people randomly, to many young healthy people are dying.  I find that I am irrationally angry with coworkers whose units/ work have not been affected by Covid, when they are posting videos of themselves and their staff laughing and joking at work and when they voice petty complaints.  I find myself very happy to be alone at home watching cable TV shows with no news or commercials.","One of our employees' 83 y.o. father in law transferred to us because an outside hospital gave him no chance to live.

I could pace myself if I knew how long it would last, but not knowing makes me wonder if I can do my job well for the long haul.

Our floor hadn't had many COVID patients previous to this and policies were changing every day - it was overwhelming to try to keep up.

I was in my patient's room with a fellow RT and resident consulting the patient's deteriorating condition. We all had N95+ masks donned at this time, the patient was actively coughing and suctioning secretions. Meanwhile, my manager was outside the room yelling at those entering (the RT and resident now present in the room) that we shouldn't be wasting N95+ masks due to the shortage.

At this time, it was unknown whether the patient had COVID (test was pending) and we were concerned because the patient was actively coughing and suctioning secretions. Also, we were discussing intubating - which an aerosolizing procedure. At that moment, I felt unsafe and belittled for both myself and my coworkers by using the PPE we were thought to be using. I was angry and anxious for the upcoming intubation event that hadn't been performed on my unit with a COVID patient yet, all the while angry and unprotected by my management.

Since that event, I had severe anxiety about whether we were actually being adequately protected with necessary PPE or not. Whether our hospital was changing policies about PPE just to protect themselves or to actually protect the frontline workers.","Our unit was able to provide ICU care along with ECMO support for a young, pregnant patient who tested positive for COVID.

I do work to support the wellbeing of faculty and others and there are times when I do not feel I'm doing enough to support all the work they do caring for patients.,"The support from leadership on our team has just been amazing. Also, the support from volunteers in the community is inspiring. Many people are lending a hand to others in need in my neighborhood and I'm glad that I can lend a hand when I am able. It makes me feel useful and it makes me feel inspired. It shows that people can come together to help strangers in a challenging time and are not only thinking about themselves and the things in their worlds that could be dragging them down.",This is a challenging line of work. Some people choose it because they want to. Others may choose it because they need the role. I think it is important that we take care of everyone during this time. To lose your life because of your work is extraordinary stress on people.

The first day that it was closed a gentleman having chest pain, saw sign for Michigan Medicine and pulled into our parking lot seeking emergency care.  Because our doors were closed and locked, he didn't have anyone to offer help.  He collapsed on the sidewalk and was in cardiac arrest.  I wasn't aware until paramedics arrived and I helplessly watched them work on him.  He died.  It drove home the cost to all of society of the dramatic changes that had to occur to our health care system.  I still suspect strongly that he died of COVID, although I will never know.  The paramedic team that worked on him did not wear PPE (not even simple surgical masks) and I am haunted by the wonder if any of them became ill.",I am grateful by the thank you signs in people's yards.,It is unfair that people are being asked to work without adequate PPE and I hate that I can no longer trust the statements of the CDC re: what PPE is actually necessary to prevent COVID-19 transmission in a healthcare setting.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The majority of these cuts are to those who were active in taking care of COVID patients. It is worse when I know that our health system has very deep pockets and that there were other ways other than having employees take the brunt of the cuts. This has left me extremely angry and frustrated!!","I was transferred from an outpatient oncology clinic to work inpatient medical wards caring solely for COVID patients. I felt very welcomed and appreciated by the other professionals I worked with. The comradery was very strong among all of us, including many of us who were transferred from other services. I made strong professional connections and friendships from my time on on the COVID units.","I worked in an inpatient, non-ICU unit, so luckily I did not have to experience the large amount of death that those units experienced. 
I will say that I am extremely frustrated, even angry, with those hospital administrators, the federal government, and those who deny or downplay the situation, believe it is a conspiracy theory, riot/revolt against public health policies, and treat healthcare workers with malice (stopping employees getting to work, calling employees ""fake"" or ""actors"", etc). These feelings can become overwhelmingly negative and can consume me at times. I know that many of my colleagues have the same feelings. These feelings can become strong enough that I question my wanting to work in the modern healthcare system.
I will also say that the front line healthcare workers, including but not limited to physicians, PA/NPs, nurses, PT/OT, RT, techs, and environmental services, have been incredible in adjusting, adapting, and thriving all in the mode of helping those who need our help the most at this time.

They had to work on our unit for a little longer than I was comfortable with before we were able to get them either reassigned to a non-COVID unit or allowed pregnancy leave 2 weeks before their babies were born. There are a lot of risks I am willing to take, and I trust the PPE that we have; but it's stressful when I have more people to consider than just myself. By God's grace, no staff members on our COVID ICU have gotten sick over the past few months; so this has helped. But that's where I wish I was just a staff nurse at times - so I can always take one for the team and just be a team player without feeling responsible for 90 other staff members.","See our team really rise to the challenging occasion has been incredible. We have such an amazing team here, and I wouldn't change it for the world.

Will they hoard PPE once it becomes widely available? Will they continue to respect regulatory ‘standards’ that are currently eliminated?

I am upset with the response and hearing everyone's opinion. The lack of accountability from the federal government, the lying from all leaders, the CDC changing language just to protect themselves. It feels like we're all being lied to. And due to that, everyone is trying to figure it out for themselves which is causing an explosion on social media, heightened emotions, anger, fear. It's just frustrating and greatly impacting morale at work. The little men look to the leaders for answers and a direction, and they're a fucking mess and it leaves us just to figure it out. Pardon my language. But you get it.",I guess exercise in general. I went on a long 10 mile walk alone and did some exploring. It just let me feel free.

Do I believe my health care institution? Do I believe the CDC who changed their policies? Do I believe our government? (YEAH RIGHT) or do we believe Joe Shmoe on facebook? because it seems like everyone else is believing that guy. Even if the facts don't align with our resources, we still deserve the truth. Even if we don't have N95s and maybe this virus has the potential to be airborne (even with the flush of a toilet) let's tell people that and militarize our supplies instead of making it so damn political. And enough with the graphs! People are not reading these graphs in a sensible way and it is just insanity. All in all, the lack of accountability and lies coming from above is frustrating and exhausting. I miss my family and my friends.

Furthermore, I personally have not felt like I can receive any of society's gratitude toward ""health care workers on the front lines"" as I have not been taking care of many COVID patients.  Therefore, we have not had the extra support / morale lift / camaraderie that seems to be apparent in other ""COVID units"" - at least as ""advertised"" by news media, social media, and commercials.

She is a year older than me (26), and we met as I was her clinical instructor at my previous job. After she graduated, she took a per-diem position within our radiology ultrasound department, and then when I left for my current role at HUP MFM, she filled into my prior position.

She is a first generation American, and lives with her mother, father, adult sister, and younger sister and brother. She contracted COVID19 at work, and subsequently brought it home to everyone in her family except her 4 year old brother. Thankfully everyone is now okay, but the waiting period to get to that point was absolutely awful. Watching an entire family, already scrutinized for the color of their skin, navigate and cope with being infected with this awful disease was absolutely heart breaking. Access to healthcare is not universal, and it could not have been more prevalent than in this situation. What's worse is this entire pandemic I have been so grateful to be at my current role which I started just before, but I cannot even begin to wonder the type of chaos and fear my old co-workers have been dealing with. This was a fear realized. She had literally no support or guidance, and still doesn't, by her healthcare network as an employee infected at work.

Sonographers already spend a very long amount of time in very close proximity to patients, having to touch them from head to toe. Most of my fellow sonographers across the country I am sure could attest to the fact that protocols have not been limited to lessen exposure time, in addition to the fact that often in radiology settings orders are placed for patients through the ED who end up testing positive shortly later, though songrpahers scan them prior without proper PPE as often the information we actually receive about patients is very limited.

I know my friend scanned multiple patients that later ended up testing as Covid19 positive.

This has made me feel hopeless, unheard, and fearfu","So many of my friends and loved ones have made an effort to thank me for the work that I am doing. I am very lucky to have friends that live all over the world, and to receive little care packages form people I miss regardless has been very encouraging and uplifting. I have felt immense love.

But with such love comes also loneliness. As a person who lives alone, this has been incredibly isolating. I want to see and hug these people. That is very, very hard.","Hanging a banner over the entrance that says, ""Welcome Heroes"", is not enough to keep us motivated as we risk our lives and the lives of or families to fight this pandemic. I can speak for many healthcare workers when I say I love what I do and I do it because I want to help people.

1) A covid patient of mine in the ICU quickly began decompensating to extremis and I was told not to enter the room (the fellow entered, but as a resident I was to stay outside), the nurse pulled the curtain and I was forced to stand on tables to see what was happening with my patient. I felt completely helpless, worthless, and full of hopeless anxiety. I felt that I had no skills to provide to the situation. I had no value. Zero. Even for the most menial of things. We decided to administer stress dose steroids, there was no nurse around me except the one inside the room, and I can't override medications in the pixis, so I just paced back and forth looking for a nurse to pull the medications. Completely useless while my patient was in extremis. One of the worst feelings of my residency. A completely different feeling than earlier years when maybe I didnt have the knowledge to help a patient in extremis.. This, I just had no value. 

2) A covid patient of mine in the ICU who had been successfully extubated, and was felt to be improving, began slowly decompensating over about 3 days with increased oxygen requirements, secretions that were difficult to manage, and an impossibly weak cough after being intubated for 3 weeks. But the hospital policy was to not allow deep suctioning of covid patients. I spent 48hrs talking to everyone I could find--respiratory therapists, nurse managers, attendings, other residents--to see what work around there was because if we didnt start suctioning, he was going to develop a mucus plug and die suddenly. The exact same scenario happened with another of my covid patients who wasnt able to be suctioned after extubation and we watched him die. I didnt want that to happen again. I couldnt watch another patient die because of a strict restriction on simple life saving techniques like suctioning. But, the system beat me, and after 48hrs of fighting the system and trying to find an alternative, it was clear that I",I'm not sure.,,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I had visited the nursing home a few days before and they were totally unprepared and had no PPE. They had requested PPE from a bunch of places but couldn't get it. The workers were so sweet and were still coming to work and were trying hard but they were spreading it around the facility. No one was doing a bad job yet there were very bad outcomes. IN the middle of that time our President made comments about health care workers stealing PPE from hospitals and saying that it wasn't that bad. I felt like he was personally killing my patients and those workers.,I really love my job and feel like I am making a difference. I have developed warm and positive feelings for many people I work with through our team approach to this crisis. I have felt that my family truly supports me and I have felt energized and more motivated to strive and do more. before this I was super burnt out and I actually feel better towards work.,Our governor has been amazing and I never thought it would make a difference but I feel like he hears me and is working for me.

That is, until someone in the department was infected.  It upset me that leadership knew we were vulnerable as it is a call center setting and no moves were being made.  Minimal communication was being relayed about what was being done in preparation, what options we, as employees, had, we were told we absolutely needed to be at work regardless of how we were feeling towards our safety during the pandemic because we are vital to the business.  Again, it took a couple of people being infected and enough employees to stand up and say, ""What are YOU doing to keep us safe?"" before changes were made.  Weeks went by.  It was like President Trump knowing about this virus, knowing it was coming, but doing nothing to prepare for the inevitable.

My mom lives out of state, my dad is deceased. My husband's parents are local and sometimes watch my children. We are both essential workers. 

We started seeing my husband's parents and my niece and nephew after about 7 weeks of isolating with just us and our two preschool aged kids.

 Today, my in-laws allowed another one of their grandkids over, my niece, who had traveled out of state from Pennsylvania to South Carolina for a road trip for a few days, out of state. Like she got out of the car after driving to South Carolina for a week and was dropped off at my in-laws house/her grandparents house like it's no big deal the entire nation is still locked down and no one is back at school or work.

And then no one, including my spouse who is on a national covid committee at his place of employment for a Fortune 500 company, could understand why I was making such a big deal out of the fact that my niece had been with all these new adults and no one was isolating themselves. She hugged my child and then everyone made me out to be a monster because I said my niece should not be in the house because of COVID. And they all just said ""oh well, she isn't sick, she's not like coughing or has a runny nose."""," more pride for essential workers nationwide; many essential workers are female, etc","Overall *working* the during COVID-19 pandemic has been a positive experience, and I mostly feel safe at work. We only wear a surgical mask and goggles in our ED; N95s are not required and only encouraged for aerosolizing procedures. 

I feel anxiety primarily because when I am not at work, I'm home with two small children and I can't go anywhere; I can't take them to play anywhere, no one else can watch them, and my husband works full time and has been back at his office for two weeks. I work full time night shift. The childcare situation is abysmal; I had to pay for their private preschool tuition IN FULL, and am now paying for my babysitter to come the day after I have work because there is no school. We earned too much money to receive any government assistance related to the pandemic. Everything feels like complete bullshit. Thanks for the free pizza.

Patient  become symptomatic and test positive for Covid. Had been caring for her for several weeks.  Had suctioned teach on multiple occasions without any PPE and then with face shield and no mask for about a week. Had reassured patient that she was at low risk because she was hospitalized before Covid was in state.  Apparently transmitted by a OT working w patient.  Caused concern for the patient who had multiple other medical issues, the other staff on the unit, and I was concerned that I could have been infected and transmitted it to my husband, and college age son now at home and adult daughter who is in same home. I was very concerned for all, angry that we did not have proper PPE w aerosolized exposure and very afraid I would transmit it to my family.  I also was very annoyed that there was so much news focused on how terrible it was for people to have to stay home when I and my coworkers were had to go to work and be exposed all while being expected to act like we thrived on our sacrifice.  And then heard news stories about how construction workers often had to lift 2 ends of a piece of equipment which put them at great risk!  And now waiting for the hospital to decide how much of a pay cut they will be doing to offset the cost of losing money during Covid.  But good news they continued to pay everyone who was not required to work for weeks and sacrificed by staying home.(sarcastic statement) Feeling like we should all be able to eat but if we are the ones to be put at risk and keep working we should not then be punished to support those who were not.",My son came home for spring break and did not go back to college but stayed with us.  Nice to have him home!,I think as a county and as a medical system (?) we should have been prepared for this. It has been known for years this would happen. I hope that once we get through this we will be more prepared for future problems. I also hope we will decide to restructure our entire health care system to treat all. We need to stop wasting so much money on people trying to beg insurance companies to cover things patients need. And stop having more people reading documentation to make sure it phrased correctly for insurance reimbursement than we have actually trying to take care of patients.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I will be needing to get MRI scan, Trasvaginal and pelvic exam ultrasound.I informed her that I would be going out of the country to get the MRI and ultrasounds. I'm really concerned about my health, and looking forward to see an endocrinologist about my MRI results while I'm out of the country. I contacted the office in farmers branch regarding if I could get a letter stating my concerns about lab results and symptoms. (Hormonal issues) (reason for my first initial visit) and was turned away to the portal notes.  The letter would benefit me to get an appointment with an endocrinologist. I'm hoping for NP Malloy can write me brief summary letter regarding my hormonal health concerns to present endocrinologist.
Good Morning Brenda Galindo,
Hope your day is well. The results that were handed to you in the office last visit is what you will need to take to any specialist in Mexico. We also sent the order to touchstone imaging if you decide you would like to have procedures done in the U.S. 
If you have any further questions or concerns, you can call the office and ask for Mayra. 
Have a nice day!

27933,2025-07-03,Patient No Show,"Pt called to schedule appt with GYN to check her bladder and kidney since she recently got out the hospital due to E.Coli; I mentioned to patient that I would first have to talk to the provider and we would give her a call back;
We have had issues with patient before; being that she continues to only call to schedule appt with GYN and she no shows, cancels, or reschedules;
When I expressed to patient I would first need to consult with provider, she became upset and asked if the doctor was the one to make decisions about being seen; I explained to her that reason being I would first need to speak to provider about scheduling appt is because she keeps scheduling appt for GYN only and she continues to NS/CX/RS appt; she became upset and asked where else she is to be seen; I did inform her she has not been seen in the clinic since 2020 and that I would need to run this by provider and would give her a call back

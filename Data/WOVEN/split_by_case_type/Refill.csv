He was going to see urologist for his high PSA in 11/24? what was dx/told to him?
He is 66 , so he should be getting medicare/medicaid and see provider in network with them. NB
Wife sent email: Hello Dr. B!
This is Joanie Graham spouse of Jackie Graham and he has tried to re-order his monthly med prescriptions and Walgreens in 
Farmers Branch says the scripts can not be filled.
The last appt Jackie had was on October 29, 2024 with Dr. Osuilleabhain MD with UTSW at the Farmers Branch clinic because
of the hallucinations he was having.
He was in the Behavioral Health Hospital @ Presby Plano from 11/27/24 thru for 9 days.  His hallucinations had gotten very bad and the meds from MEtro Care were not working at the time.  The hospital stay really helped him.  I gave them your clinic information at the hospital for them to forward his information to you.
He is still seeing Metro Care for his antipsychotic meds.
However he has been out of his BP meds and Cholesterol meds for 4 days now.  Can he still get a refill and schedule another appt like he was doing every 3 months??
We also never heard any response from Dr. Goldberg/Urologist after Jackie went to see him at the Lewisville clinic.  Dr. Goldberg's office had Jackie do a specimen at the lab in Carrollton, but we never heard any results. Dr Goldberg said he felt like we needed to be going to Parkland low income clinic for help with 
the prostate issue.
Could you or someone call me regarding an appt. for him?
We both are very concerned he is not on any BP meds.
Thank you and we look forward to hearing back from your office.
Regards,
Joanie Graham/214-710-9178
I can send him Med refill for now
However considering his ongoing need for specialist and age criteria ( over 65), he shoudl be applying for Medicare/Medicaid or parkland.
we do not have specialist care. I can give him refill but sugg him one of the above option for ongoing care that he needs.  Pls inform pt or wife. NB

I wanted to give an update on how the new medication is doing, after giving it a few days, it somehow increased my mood and anxiety the first couple days. I don't know if it is due to the MG level or the medication itself isn't working as well as setraline.
If the only side effect for the setraline are nightmares, are there things I can do to counter it, such as calendar tea before bed or meditation. I feel that has really worked. If it needs to wait until the appointment on the 10th. Let me know.
Have a Happy New Year!
Thank you.

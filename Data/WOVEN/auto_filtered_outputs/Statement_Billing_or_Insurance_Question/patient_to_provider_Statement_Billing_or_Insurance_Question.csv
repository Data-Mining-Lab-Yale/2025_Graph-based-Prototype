30519,2023-04-24,"Statement, Billing, or Insurance Question","I was wondering if it was possible for either Dr. Barbaria or Dr. Poonam could write a letter explaining the illnesses that I've had during my recent sick visits. I had one in February or January and one in April. I have a class that I will unfortunately be failing as I have missed 8 classes due to illness. In order to withdraw from the class, I need a doctor's note on professional letterhead explaining what illness I had that caused me to miss my class. Would that be possible?
I printed letter for her. Jacky will cll pt n ask her to pick up letter.

Hello  Mrs, Roach   I received a message from our Person2 here in clinic stating your request of a Diagnotic ultrasound, I spoke with the provider that saw you last and placed your last order. unfortunately we can not proceed with this request. Per provider she would like for you to dola screening, not diagnostic. This can be a self pay or we can go through another program that is called ABCF i can not guarantee that it will be approve. Please let me know of what would you like to do. Thank you [Originally sent by: Person3]     Yes I would like to proceed with this my only question is how is the screening different from a mammogram that I just had? The mammogram does not show what an ultrasound does. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m just scared that since there is breast cancer in my family that a mammogram does not detect because I have dense breast. My sister was able to have hers detected in stage one and without the diagnostic ultrasound it would have not shown in the early stage. Why can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t I get any help with this. I do no have any other insurance that I can use nor do I have the money for self pay  [Message from: ROACH, PILAR] Yes proceed with this request please  I am sorry, I am following provider order in regards of the referral order. Since Org7 don't cover the screening it would have to be a self pay or go through the ABCF grant. I can go ahead and send out an order to Org7  if you would like to give it try fro that grant.

17684,2024-10-03,Clinical Question,"Hello this is Joanie Graham wife of your patient Jackie (Jack) Graham.
I tried to call the office couple of times but was unable to leave a message.
He has an appointment at the UTSW office in Lewisville on 11/4/24 with an urologist due to the prostate number being high.
They will work with us on the cost of the appointment to allow us to pay an amount that day and the balance out each month. 
I would greatly appreciate if you could call me at 214-710-9178 anytime is fine.
I am concerned about something with him.  About the past couple of months he has episodes of hallucinations.
Some days he is fine and other days he literally says he sees spiders crawling on him. Sometimes it last just a short time
other times its longer.
He is not having headaches, blurred vision or taking any new medication.  But it is really upsetting when he starts seeing these
spiders.
I know this probably sounds very strange. Could you please see him or email me back regarding this.
He is very comfortable with you as his doctor.  He has never had anything like this happen to him before the last couple of month.
I would like to see him and sugg his wife to come with him.
I want 40-60 min slot with him, he is hard of hearing and his visit takes longer, I need more time for this visit.
I see 10/4/24- afternoon at 2 PM is open, can we schl him there?
pls call wife n schl appnt. NB",2024-10-03,0,0,1,0

He was going to see urologist for his high PSA in 11/24? what was dx/told to him?
He is 66 , so he should be getting medicare/medicaid and see provider in network with them. NB
Wife sent email: Hello Dr. B!
This is Joanie Graham spouse of Jackie Graham and he has tried to re-order his monthly med prescriptions and Walgreens in 
Farmers Branch says the scripts can not be filled.
The last appt Jackie had was on October 29, 2024 with Dr. Osuilleabhain MD with UTSW at the Farmers Branch clinic because
of the hallucinations he was having.
He was in the Behavioral Health Hospital @ Presby Plano from 11/27/24 thru for 9 days.  His hallucinations had gotten very bad and the meds from MEtro Care were not working at the time.  The hospital stay really helped him.  I gave them your clinic information at the hospital for them to forward his information to you.
He is still seeing Metro Care for his antipsychotic meds.
However he has been out of his BP meds and Cholesterol meds for 4 days now.  Can he still get a refill and schedule another appt like he was doing every 3 months??
We also never heard any response from Dr. Goldberg/Urologist after Jackie went to see him at the Lewisville clinic.  Dr. Goldberg's office had Jackie do a specimen at the lab in Carrollton, but we never heard any results. Dr Goldberg said he felt like we needed to be going to Parkland low income clinic for help with 
the prostate issue.
Could you or someone call me regarding an appt. for him?
We both are very concerned he is not on any BP meds.
Thank you and we look forward to hearing back from your office.
Regards,
Joanie Graham/214-710-9178
I can send him Med refill for now
However considering his ongoing need for specialist and age criteria ( over 65), he shoudl be applying for Medicare/Medicaid or parkland.
we do not have specialist care. I can give him refill but sugg him one of the above option for ongoing care that he needs.  Pls inform pt or wife. NB

We have had issues with patient before; being that she continues to only call to schedule appt with GYN and she no shows, cancels, or reschedules;
When I expressed to patient I would first need to consult with provider, she became upset and asked if the doctor was the one to make decisions about being seen; I explained to her that reason being I would first need to speak to provider about scheduling appt is because she keeps scheduling appt for GYN only and she continues to NS/CX/RS appt; she became upset and asked where else she is to be seen; I did inform her she has not been seen in the clinic since 2020 and that I would need to run this by provider and would give her a call back

32799,2023-12-26,Clinical Question,"Good Morning
My doctor is Dr. Misra and I have a question when it comes to taking the Setraline 2 times a day after 10 days. I am hesitant and wasn't able to reach out on Friday when it started. I've been having nightmares and I think it's due to the anxiety medicine but would like to know how to proceed
I'll be available all day if anyone needs to reach me.
Thank you.

32799,2023-12-31,Refill,"Good Morning.
I wanted to give an update on how the new medication is doing, after giving it a few days, it somehow increased my mood and anxiety the first couple days. I don't know if it is due to the MG level or the medication itself isn't working as well as setraline.
If the only side effect for the setraline are nightmares, are there things I can do to counter it, such as calendar tea before bed or meditation. I feel that has really worked. If it needs to wait until the appointment on the 10th. Let me know.
Have a Happy New Year!
Thank you.
Erika.

I will be needing to get MRI scan, Trasvaginal and pelvic exam ultrasound.I informed her that I would be going out of the country to get the MRI and ultrasounds. I'm really concerned about my health, and looking forward to see an endocrinologist about my MRI results while I'm out of the country. I contacted the office in farmers branch regarding if I could get a letter stating my concerns about lab results and symptoms. (Hormonal issues) (reason for my first initial visit) and was turned away to the portal notes.  The letter would benefit me to get an appointment with an endocrinologist. I'm hoping for NP Malloy can write me brief summary letter regarding my hormonal health concerns to present endocrinologist.
Good Morning Brenda Galindo,
Hope your day is well. The results that were handed to you in the office last visit is what you will need to take to any specialist in Mexico. We also sent the order to touchstone imaging if you decide you would like to have procedures done in the U.S. 
If you have any further questions or concerns, you can call the office and ask for Mayra. 
Have a nice day!

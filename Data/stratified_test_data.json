I thought we were doing the CA 27 Dash 29 that I have always had done but no results have come in for that. A test result for CEA came in but I don't know what that is. I have nothing to compare that to although it appears the numbers pretty high which is concerning. I was wondering if there was a reason for switching to a different test? The 27/29 has been a good indicator for me in the past. Thank you",
